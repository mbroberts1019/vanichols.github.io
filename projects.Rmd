##Do more diverse crop rotations reduce weed pressure?

-**Status:** Submitted. The dataset is being published through ISU's [DataShare](http://instr.iastate.libguides.com/datashare)


##Maize and soybean root distributions in Iowa, USA

-**Status:** On version 13.  


##Does using cover crops increase the water-holding capacity of soil?

-**Status:** In progress. Thanks to the North Central Sustainable Agriculture Research and Eduction graduate student grant for funding this fun project where I'm collaborating with [PFI](https://practicalfarmers.org/)


##Do cover crops change the amount/makeup of weed seeds?

-**Status:** Another PFI collaboration. In progress. Soil sampling will happen when the soil thaws. Which *will* happen. I'm sure of it...
